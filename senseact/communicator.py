class Communicator(Process):
    """An abstract base class for device-specific packet communicators.

    Communicators create interface between a physical device and
    a Reinforcement Learning system. A communciator facilitates reading
    sensory data from the device and sending actuation data to the device
    if applicable. A communicator runs two python threads,
    one of them "listens" to device and transfer sensory data as soon
    as those are available, the other waits on actuation commands from RL
    system and transfers those to the device as soon as those are available.
    The threads are run asynchronous in order to avoid blocking and unnecessary
    delays. Typically, one would create one instance of Communicator
    per device, which will handle the packet communication with that device,
    for example, a Dynamixel actuator or a camera. A Communicator object
    can be instantiated by inheriting this class and implementing _sensor_handler
    for listening to a device and implementing _actor_handler to transfer
    actuation commands. The two python threads run these two methods continually.
    There can be communicators having only one of the methods implemented and
    thus running only one of the threads for a device with simplex communication.

    Attrbiutes:
        use_sensor: a boolean specifying whether given communicator
            transmits sensory data.
        use_actuator: a boolean specifying whether given communicator
            transmits actuation data
        sensor_buffer: a SharedBuffer object containing the latest sensory
            data to be received from a device and stored in the buffer by
            _sensor_handler
        actuator_buffer: a SharedBuffer object containing the latest
            actuation data based on agent's action, which is to be received
            from the buffer by _actuator_handler
