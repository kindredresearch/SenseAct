# Background
>The DYNAMIXEL is a smart actuator system developed to be the exclusive connecting joints on a
robot or mechanical structure. DYNAMIXELSâ€™ are designed to be modular and daisy chained on any robot

Dynamixel motors can be easily used to build custom robots ranging from 3-DOF robot arms to humanoids.
To control Dynamixel, communication should be established according to its protocol. We used DXL MX-64AT
and AX-12A servos for all our experiments. They use [Protocol 1.0](http://support.robotis.com/en/product/actuator/dynamixel/dxl_communication.htm)
for half duplex UART serial communication. The motors are driven by sending and receiving binary data.

We used a Xevelabs USB2AX v3.2a USB to TTL Dynamixel servo interface for connecting the motors to the computer.

# Setting the Baudrate and Device ID

The easiest way to configure a Dynamixel device, especially if you don't know the baudrate or device ID, is via the [RoboPlus Dynamixel Wizard](http://support.robotis.com/en/software/roboplus/dynamixel_monitor.htm) ([download here](http://en.robotis.com/service/downloadpage.php?ca_id=10)). There is a search tool which scans all possible bauds and and IDs.
Unfortunately, the software is supported only on Windows. That said, we could also configure the device
using our custom python script:

- [dxl_basic_functions.py](dxl_basic_functions.py) can be used to configure DXL MX-64 series servos

Typically, new servos have default `device ID = 1` and `baudrate = 57142`. In that case, specify `baudrate = 57142` and `idn = 1` in lines 17 and 18 of the dxl_basic_functions script, respectively. For example, the following commands
to change the baudrate and device ID number to 1 million and 9 respectively.

```python
write_to_register('baud', 1000000)
write_to_register('bus_id', 9)
```

 We also recommend setting the [Return Delay Time](http://support.robotis.com/en/product/actuator/dynamixel/mx_series/mx-64at_ar.htm#Actuator_Address_05)
 to zero. That can be done using the following command:

 ```python
write_to_register('rtd', 0)
```

# Setting up the Dynamixel device for your first experiment
Identify the port and make it available to be used. If you are using a USB2AX device:

```
 sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyACM0
```

If you are using a Robotis USB2Dynamixel device:

```
 sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0
```

There are plenty of examples specified within the `senseact/lib/DynamixelSDK/python/protocol1_0/` folder.

Executing a chmod command to access the serial device every time we connect a serial device is annoying
to say the least. In order to allow a non-default user to use serial device, all we need to do is add the
user to the `dialout` group:

```bash
sudo adduser user_name dialout
```

However, for this change to take effect, the user has to logout and then login again.

If you see this error message, it is highly likely that you are using the wrong baudrate or device ID number
to establish a serial connection with your DXL device. You may want to find the correct values using the [RoboPlus Dynamixel Wizard](http://support.robotis.com/en/software/roboplus/dynamixel_monitor.htm) ([download here](http://en.robotis.com/service/downloadpage.php?ca_id=10)) for its search tool to scan all possible bauds and and IDs. Although the tool is Windows only.

## IOError
If you are unable to establish a serial connection with your DXL, try running this command and then try to
run your DXl test:

```bash
 sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyACM0
```
