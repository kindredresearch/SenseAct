# SenseAct: A computational framework for real-world robot learning tasks

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-BSD%203--Clause-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

This repository provides the implementation of several reinforcement learning tasks with multiple real-world robots.
These tasks come with an interface similar to [OpenAI-Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) so that learning algorithms can be plugged in easily and in a uniform manner across tasks.
All the tasks here are implemented based on a computational framework of robot-agent communication proposed by Mahmood et al. (2018a), which we call *SenseAct*.
In this computational framework, agent and environment-related computations are ordered and distributed among multiple concurrent processes in a specific way. By doing so, SenseAct enables the following:

- Timely communication between the learning agent and multiple robotic devices with reduced latency,
- Easy and systematic design of robotic tasks for reinforcement learning agents,
- Facilitate reproducible real-world reinforcement learning.

This repository provides the following real-world robotic tasks, which are proposed by Mahmood et al. (2018b) as benchmark tasks for reinforcement learning algorithms:

### Universal-Robots (UR) robotic arms:
- [UR-Reacher](https://github.com/kindredresearch/SenseAct/blob/master/senseact/envs/ur/reacher_env.py) (both 2 joint and 6 joint control)

| --- | --- |

Tested on UR Software v. 3.3.4.310
### Dynamixel (DXL) actuators:
Currently we only support MX-64AT.
- [DXL-Reacher](https://github.com/kindredresearch/SenseAct/blob/master/senseact/envs/dxl/dxl_reacher_env.py)
- [DXL-Tracker](https://github.com/kindredresearch/SenseAct/blob/master/senseact/envs/dxl/dxl_tracker_env.py)

### iRobot Create 2 robots:
- [Create-Mover](https://github.com/kindredresearch/SenseAct/blob/master/senseact/envs/create2/create2_mover_env.py)
- [Create-Docker](https://github.com/kindredresearch/SenseAct/blob/master/senseact/envs/create2/create2_docker_env.py)

Mahmood et al. (2018b) provide extensive results comparing multiple reinforcement learning algorithms on the above tasks, and Mahmood et al. (2018a) show the effect of different task-setup elements in learning. Their results can be reproduced by using this repository (see [documentation](docs/) for more information).

# Installation

SenseAct uses Python3 (>=3.5), and all other requirements are automatically installed via pip.

On Linux and Mac OS X, run the following:
1. `git clone https://github.com/kindredresearch/SenseAct.git`
1. `cd SenseAct`
1. `pip install -e .` or `pip3 install -e .` depends on your setup

Additional instruction for installing [OpenAI Baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines) needed for running the [advanced examples](examples/advanced) is given in the [corresponding readme](examples/).

### Additional installation steps for Dynamixel-based tasks (Linux only)

Dynamixels can be controlled by drivers written using either ctypes by [Robotis](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/DynamixelSDK/releases/tag/3.5.4) or pyserial, which can be chosen by passing either `True` (ctypes) or `False` (pyserial) as an argument to the `use_ctypes_driver` parameter of a Dynamixel-based task (e.g., see `examples/advanced/dxl_reacher.py`). We found the ctypes-based driver to provide substantially more timely and precise communication compared to the pyserial-based one.

In order to use the CType-based driver, we need to install gcc and relevant packages for compiling the C libraries:

`sudo apt-get install gcc-5 build-essential gcc-multilib g++-multilib`

Then run the following script to download and compile the Dynamixel driver C libraries:

`sudo bash setup_dxl.sh`

For additional setup and troubleshooting information regarding Dynamixels, please see [DXL Docs](senseact/devices/dxl/).

### Tests

You can check whether SenseAct is installed correctly by running the included unit tests.

```bash
cd SenseAct
python -m unittest discover -b
```
